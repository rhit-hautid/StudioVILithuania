<b> Castle History: Norviliskes </b> <br> Norviliškės Castle, a Renaissance-style castle dating back to 1586, is also known <br> as Norviliškės Manor. Franciscans constructed a monastery and church on <br> a portion of the castle's land in the mid-18th century, with the former being <br> reconstructed later by Kazimieras Kaminskis. After the November Uprising of 1831,<br> the Russian authorities converted the monastery into a barracks and a <br> boarding school for girls, leading to the closure of the Church of St. Mary <br> Compassionate Mother. However, the castle underwent reconstruction in 2005 <br> and is now a tourist attraction offering hosting for weddings, business conferences,<br> hunting, shooting practices, music festivals, tours, and other activities.
