<b> Castle History <br> Norviliskes  </b> <br> Norviliskes Castle, Dating back to 1586, Norviliškės Castle is a Renaissance-style castle also known as Norviliškės Manor. In 1745, Franciscans constructed a monastery and church on a portion of the castle's land, with the former being reconstructed in the late 18th century by Kazimieras Kaminskis. Following the November Uprising of 1831, the Russian authorities converted the monastery into a barracks and a boarding school for girls, leading to the closure of the Church of St. Mary Compassionate Mother. However, a new wooden church was built in 1929. Despite remaining abandoned for a long time, reconstruction of the castle began in 2005 with the support of the PHARE program. Norviliškės Castle is now a tourist attraction which offers hosting for business conferences, weddings, hunting, shooting practices, music festivals, tours, and other activities.
