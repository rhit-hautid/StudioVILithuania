<b> Castle History <br> Trakai  </b> <br> Trakai Castle, Trakai Island Castle is a historic castle complex in Lithuania built in different stages. Its construction began in the mid-14th century and was commissioned by Kęstutis, the Grand Duke of Lithuania. After being damaged during a Teutonic Knights' attack, the castle was expanded in the 15th century with the addition of walls and defensive towers. After the Battle of Grunwald, it became the permanent residence of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and in the 16th century was renovated in a Renaissance style by Sigismund Augustus, King of Poland. The castle served as a prison and was damaged during wars in the 17th century. In the 20th century, the castle underwent several restoration attempts. The southeastern castle tower was rebuilt between 1935 and 1941, but restoration stopped during World War II. Active work on the restoration began again in 1953 and was completed in 1961, when the museum opened. Today, the castle appears as it did in the 15th century with a fortified tower, living quarters, and a chapel.
