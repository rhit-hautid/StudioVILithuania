<b> Castle History: Klaipeda </b> <br> Klaipeda Castle, also known as Memelburg or Memel Castle, is an <br> archaeological site and museum located in Klaipeda, Lithuania. The castle <br> was originally built by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century as part of their <br> ongoing war against the Prussians. The original wooden castle was quickly <br> replaced by a stone castle in 1253 due to the low-lying area. The castle was <br> destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout history, including a significant <br> destruction in 1379 by the Samogitians and Lithuanians. Despite losing military <br> importance in the late 18th century, a museum was opened in the castle in 2002, <br> and it has become one of Klaipeda's most popular tourist attractions. <br> The castle also hosts the annual Klaipeda Castle Jazz Festival.
