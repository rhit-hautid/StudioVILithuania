<b> Castle History <br> Klaipeda </b> <br> Klaipeda Castle, also known as Memelburg or Memel Castle, is an archaeological site and museum located in Klaipeda, Lithuania. The castle was originally built by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century as part of their ongoing war against the Prussians. The original wooden castle was quickly replaced by a stone castle in 1253 due to the low-lying area. The castle was destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout history, including a significant destruction in 1379 by the Samogitians and Lithuanians. Despite losing military importance in the late 18th century, a museum was opened in the castle in 2002, and it has become one of Klaipeda's most popular tourist attractions. The castle also hosts the annual Klaipeda Castle Jazz Festival.
