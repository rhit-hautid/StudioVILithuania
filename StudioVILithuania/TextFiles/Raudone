<b> Castle History: Raudone </b> <br> Raudone Castle, In the late 16th century, Raudonė Castle was constructed on <br>the ruins of the old castle during the reign of King Sigismund II August. <br>Hieronymus Krispin-Kirschenstein, a German knight, built the new renaissance <br>castle, which has been rebuilt many times since. In the 18th century, the Olędzki <br>family commissioned Wawrzyniec Gucewicz to renovate the castle. In the 19th <br>century, the Zubov family acquired the estate, and their architect Cesare Anichini <br>transformed the castle into an example of neo-Gothic architecture. The last private <br>owners were Sophia Waxell and her Portuguese husband, José Carlos de<br> Faria e Castro. Today, the castle houses the legend of 'The White Maiden of <br>the Bayersburg' and serves as an example of 19th-century architecture.
