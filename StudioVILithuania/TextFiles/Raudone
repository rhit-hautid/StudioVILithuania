<b> Castle History <br> Raudone  </b> <br> Raudone Castle, In the late 16th century, Raudonė Castle was constructed on the ruins of the old castle during the reign of King Sigismund II August. Hieronymus Krispin-Kirschenstein, a German knight, built the new renaissance castle, which has been rebuilt many times since. In the 18th century, the Olędzki family commissioned Wawrzyniec Gucewicz to renovate the castle. In the 19th century, the Zubov family acquired the estate, and their architect Cesare Anichini transformed the castle into an example of neo-Gothic architecture. The last private owners were Sophia Waxell and her Portuguese husband, José Carlos de Faria e Castro. Today, the castle houses the legend of 'The White Maiden of the Bayersburg' and serves as an example of 19th-century architecture.
