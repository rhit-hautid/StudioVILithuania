<b> Castle History <br> Panemune  </b> <br> Panemune Castle, The Teutonic Knights' hillfort in Panemunė, dating back to 1343, was replaced by a 17th-century feudal castle built by Hungarian nobleman Eperjesh, who purchased the surrounding lands. The castle boasts defensive structures, living quarters, and farm buildings and sits atop a high hill surrounded by five cascading ponds. After being reconstructed in 1759 by the Giełgud family, the castle fell into decay during the 19th century. In 1925, the Lithuanian government acquired the castle, and in 1935 it became the responsibility of the Lithuanian Culture department. Now the castle houses a museum, exhibition spaces and tourist information centre. The redesigned castle court is used as a venue for various cultural activities: musical events, festivals, traditional craft fairs.
