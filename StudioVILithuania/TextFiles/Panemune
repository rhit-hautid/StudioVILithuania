<b> Castle History: Panemune </b> <br> Panemune Castle, The Teutonic Knights' hillfort in Panemunė, dating back <br>to 1343, was replaced by a 17th-century feudal castle built by Hungarian <br>nobleman Eperjesh, who purchased the surrounding lands. The castle <br> boasts defensive structures, living quarters, and farm buildings and sits atop <br>a high hill surrounded by five cascading ponds. After being reconstructed <br> in 1759 by the Giełgud family, the castle fell into decay during the 19th century. <br>In 1925, the Lithuanian government acquired the castle, and in 1935 it became <br>the responsibility of the Lithuanian Culture department. Now the castle houses <br>a museum, exhibition spaces and tourist information centre. The castle court is <br>used for various cultural activities: music, festivals, and traditional craft fairs.
