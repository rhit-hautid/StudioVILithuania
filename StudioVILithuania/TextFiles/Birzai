<b> Castle History <br> Brizai  </b> <br> Birzai Castle, commissioned by Duke Kristupas Radvila, served to defend <br> the northern border of Lithuania. Its construction began in 1586, and it became <br> the main seat of the Birzai-Dubingiai Radziwiłł family. During the wars <br> with Sweden, it was a crucial defensive structure. However, it was heavily <br> damaged and destroyed by the Swedes in the 17th century. Despite attempts <br> to rebuild it, it was once again taken by the Swedes and ultimately <br> destroyed. In the 1980s, the castle was restored in the Renaissance-Baroque <br> style and now houses a library and a regional history museum <br> called 'Sėla'. It also serves as the Birzai Regional Museum, <br> offering educational programs for visitors.
