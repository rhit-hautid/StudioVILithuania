<b> Castle History <br> Brizai  </b> <br> Birzai Castle, commissioned by Duke Kristupas Radvila, <br> served to defend the northern border of Lithuania. <br> Its construction began in 1586, <br> and it became the main seat of the Birzai-Dubingiai Radziwiłł family. <br> During the wars with Sweden, it was a crucial defensive structure. <br> However, it was heavily damaged and destroyed <br> by the Swedes in the 17th century. <br> Despite attempts to rebuild it, <br> it was once again taken by the Swedes and ultimately destroyed. <br> In the 1980s, the castle was restored in the <br> Renaissance-Baroque style and now houses <br> a library and a regional history museum <br> called 'Sėla'. It also serves as the Birzai Regional Museum, <br> offering educational programs for visitors.
