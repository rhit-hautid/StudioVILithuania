<b> Castle History <br> Siesikai  </b> <br> Siesikai Castle, Siesikai Castle in Lithuania was built in the 16th century, and passed to Michal Antoni Radziwiłł in the early 18th century. Later, Dominykas Daugėla renovated the castle in the Classicist style and it became known for its collection of paintings, guns, and manuscripts. In 1940, the manor was nationalized and later abandoned. In 1992, it was recognized as a national heritage site. Restoration work has been ongoing, and the first floor is complete, while the second is still underway. The castle's unique features include shooting openings, water-filled moats, and wall paintings dating to the mid-17th century, as well as windows and doors that are aligned to create a unique spectacle during solstices and equinoxes. It is thought that this feature relates to the philosophy of Renaissance Neoplatonism.
