<b> Castle History: Siesikai </b> <br> Siesikai Castle, constructed in the 16th century, was once owned by Michal <br>Antoni Radziwiłł before being renovated in the Classicist style by Dominykas <br>Daugėla.The castle boasted an impressive collection of paintings, guns, and <br>manuscripts. In 1940, the manor was nationalized and abandoned, but it <br>was later recognized as a national heritage site in 1992. Ongoing restoration<br> work has been carried out, with the first floor now complete and the second<br> floor still in progress. Notable features of the castle include shooting openings,<br> water-filled moats, wall paintings from the mid-17th century, and windows and <br>doors arranged to create a unique spectacle during solstices and equinoxes, <br>believed to reflect the philosophy of Renaissance Neoplatonism.
