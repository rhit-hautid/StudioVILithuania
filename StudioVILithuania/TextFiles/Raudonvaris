<b> Castle History <br> Raidonvaris  </b> <br> Raidonvaris Castle, Raudondvaris is a significant location in Lithuania, famous for its white church towers, town, and park. It has great ethnographic significance and was first mentioned as a noble residence in 1615. The crusaders built a castle there in 1392, which eventually lost its defensive significance. Pakamaris V. Dziavaltauskas then built a castle-shaped manor on the upper terrace of the Nevėžis banks, serving as the manor of the Grand Duke. From the early 19th century until World War I, the Tiškevičiai family owned the manor, which consisted of a 17th-century Renaissance palace, northern and southern officina conservatories, and a Classicism and neo-Gothic conservatory built in 1837-1839. However, the castle was destroyed, and all the treasures were taken to Poland and other countries during World War I. The Germans used the palace as their headquarters, and Arnold Zweig depicted its luxurious rooms and library in his novel Mindaugas II (1937). After the war, the manor remained with the Tiškevičiai family, but they did not return. From 1927 to 1942, the Lithuanian Women’s Welfare Committee operated a children care home in the manor house. World War II caused more damage to the manor, but the butler's house, stables, steward's house, north and south barns, ice cream parlor, and park were restored in 2010-2013.
