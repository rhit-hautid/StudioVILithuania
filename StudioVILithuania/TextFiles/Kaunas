<b> Castle History: Kaunas </b> <br> Kaunas Castle, one of Lithuania's earliest stone castles, was built in the <br> 14th century to defend against crusaders. Although it once thrived as a <br> settlement, it lost its importance when Kaunas gained Magdeburg rights in <br> 1408. Despite renovations, the castle later served as a prison, and its inmates <br> are said to still haunt it. Today, the castle is a museum branch of Kaunas city <br> and hosts cultural events. Nearby Santaka Park features several <br> attractions, including the altar for pagan rituals, Pope Hill, where Popes  <br> John Paul II and Francis celebrated mass, the Statue of Pope John Paul II, <br> St. George the Martyr Church, and the Bernardine Monastery.
