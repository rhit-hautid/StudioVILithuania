<b> Castle History <br> Kaunas </b> <br> Kaunas Castle, a defensive structure constructed in the 14th century to protect against crusaders, features two rows of defensive walls, making it one of Lithuania's earliest stone castles. The Gothic defenses gave rise to a settlement that grew around the castle. However, when Kaunas was granted Magdeburg rights in 1408, the castle lost its importance. Despite being restored several times, the castle eventually served as a prison in the 16th century, and the souls of its inmates are rumored to haunt the castle to this day. Today, the castle is a museum branch of Kaunas city, and it is the site of annual cultural events. Nearby, Santaka Park is known as the heart of Kaunas and features the altar that was used for pagan rituals, Pope Hill, where Pope John Paul II celebrated mass in 1993 and Pope Francis did so in 2018, the Statue of Pope John Paul II, St. George the Martyr Church, and the Bernardine Monastery.
