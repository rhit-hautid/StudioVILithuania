<b> Castle History <br> Medininkai  </b> <br> Medininkai Castle, Medininkai Castle, built in the late 13th century, has the largest enclosure of all castles in Lithuania, covering a perimeter of 6.5 hectares. Its rectangular design on flat ground was made for flank defence and included a 1.8-hectare courtyard, 4 gates, and towers. The 30-metre main tower was used as a residence. After severe fire damage in the late 15th century, the castle was unsuitable for defence and used as a residence until its destruction in the war with Russia in 1655. German forces destroyed one of its towers during World War II.
